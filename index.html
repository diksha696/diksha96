<h4><b>What is cloud computing ?</b></h4>
<br>
Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet. These services are divided into three main categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS).

A cloud can be private or public. A public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet. A private cloud is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted services to a limited number of people, with certain access and permissions settings. Private or public, the goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable access to computing resources and IT services.
<br>
Cloud infrastructure involves the hardware and software components required for proper implementation of a cloud computing model. Cloud computing can also be thought of as utility computing, or on-demand computing.

<h4><b>What cloud computing services are available?</b></h4>
<br>
Cloud computing services cover a vast range of options now, from the basics of storage, networking, and processing power through to natural language processing and artificial intelligence as well as standard office applications. Pretty much any service that doesn't require you to be physically close to the computer hardware that you are using can now be delivered via the cloud.
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h4><b>What are the Characteristics of Cloud Computing ?</b></h4>
<br>
<b><u>1) On-demand self-service: </b></u>You can use it whenever you need it and pay per use. Think of it as electricity. In essence, the cloud is a form of utility computing. You create an account or pick your provider, and your services will be available to you anytime. <br>You are billed at the end of the month only for what you used. This form of storing and accessing your data gives you full control over your resource usage and spending.<br>
<br>
<b><u>2) Broad network access: </b></u>You must be able to access from across the web using any device with internet connectivity. Wherever you are, your cloud data will be accessible through web browsers, as well as on a laptop or mobile devices.<br> The reason for this is the fact its underlying infrastructure includes servers on multiple locations.<br>
<br>
<b><u>3) Resource pooling:</b></u> Multiple tenants can share the same space, and resources can be assigned, re-assigned, and distributed as needed. You can be anywhere in the world and still have equal access as everyone else, provided you have internet access.
<br>
<b><u>4) Rapid elasticity: </b></u>Cloud can grow and shrink as much as possible without affecting any of its users or their information. For example, if your business is experiencing peak traffic, the cloud can expand to accommodate all the new requests.
<br>
<b><u>5) Measured service: </b></u>You can examine how often people are using the cloud. Many cloud service providers utilize a pay-as-you-go model to ensure that their clients are getting what they pay for, no more and no less. <br>Once again, this can be compared to electricity as you get billed for the amount that you use.
<br>
<h4><b>What are the types of Cloud Computing?</b></h4>

<br>
1) Public Cloud
Public cloud services are best for development systems and web servers. Your cloud computing provider will give you a slice of their digital space that they must share with other tenants.

These types of clouds are cost-efficient since a pay-as-you-go model operates most. <br>You pay for the number of hours you need to use the cloud and can exit whenever you complete your work. There are no obligations that require you to pay more than you need.
<br>
2) Private Cloud
Private clouds offer what their name suggests: privacy. You do not have to share your digital space with anyone else. Private cloud platforms are typically built in-house, and they belong to you and your business. They can also be configured in a  third-party data center and still provide an advanced level of privacy.
<br>
Larger organizations and clients who are concerned about security favor private clouds. The reason for this is primarily the fact that these clouds offer more defense than their public counterparts. <br>Companies that need to protect sensitive information like customer data rely on private clouds.

If you are using a private cloud, you know who has access to the data, know if anyone made changes, and know what to do in case of an emergency.<br> You have full control over what happens to the cloud and don’t have to worry about some third party vendor making changes that would negatively affect you. A firewall protects everything in your cloud from outsiders.
<br>
3) Hybrid Clouds:<br>
Hybrid clouds are the best of both worlds. If you are using a hybrid cloud, you can control an internal database and use the public cloud when needed. There might be times when you will need to move data and applications from the private cloud to the public cloud, such as scheduled maintenance, <br>blackouts, and natural disasters. The ability to seamlessly migrate information is perfect for cloud-based disaster recovery and preventing data loss.
<br>
The flexibility of hybrid clouds is excellent for scaling as any overflow can regulate in the public cloud. Furthermore, you can keep all non-sensitive tasks in the public cloud while safeguarding the essential data in the private cloud.
<br>
Regardless of how large your company is or what industry it serves, there will always be a cloud solution that best fits your needs. Take the time to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each kind before deciding.

<h4><b>What are the types of Cloud Services?</b></h4>
<br>
Cloud services are as varied as the types of clouds themselves. You can purchase three different kinds of cloud services:
<br><br>
1)<b><u>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) </b></u>saves you money on buying physical data centers or servers. You pay as you go and only pay for as long as you need or use the service. <br>IaaS allows you to adjust your scale depending on your demand quickly.
<br><br><br>
2)<b><u>Platform as a service (PaaS)</b></u> has everything you need for your business applications. It comes complete with infrastructures such as networking, online storage, and <br>servers, as well as database management systems, development tools, and more. PaaS is designed to help create, test, develop, and update your application.
<br><br><br>
3)<b><u>Software as a service (SaaS)</b></u> is what you get whenever you download a new app for your phone. Companies create and develop their software and then lend it out to buyers. <br>Businesses such as Autodesk, Lending Club, Microsoft, and IBM all generate revenue from SaaS.
